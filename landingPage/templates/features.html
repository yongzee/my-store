      <h3>Short-Form Product Videos</h3>
      <p>
        Every vendor must post a short video for each product, making listings more trustworthy and visually appealing. Think of it as a TikTok-style shop window — videos help buyers see movement, shine, and detail that pictures can't capture alone. Videos appear in a scrollable feed to keep users engaged and exploring.

      <h3>Direct Vendor Communication</h3>
      <p>
        No complex checkout system — just connect and deal. Buyers can reach sellers directly via WhatsApp, phone, or social media links on the vendor’s profile. This makes it easier to ask questions, negotiate, or arrange delivery based on your location and preferences. It brings back the human touch to online buying.
